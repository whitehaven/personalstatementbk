## CEF

This program is similar to a traditional chief resident year, but more focus is placed on building didactic skills and completing long-term education projects. This program resembles a traditional chief resident year but emphasizes developing didactic skills and completing long-term education projects.

I serve as attending physician in the inpatient and clinic settings while working on my projects in the background. Additionally, I teach regularly on inpatient rounds and at noon conference.

My ongoing research project is detailed below.

### Most Meaningful #1

- [ ] submitted

In this role, I've felt a heightened responsibility, but not from sources I expected. While my training prepared me for the medical aspect, creating a team environment with appropriate autonomy has required more thought and care. As I have improved, it is gratifying to witness my trainees' growth.

## Sacred Heart Medical Center Sepsis Committee

- [x] submitted

I meet monthly with the Sepsis Committee to establish and update standards for prompt and guideline-driven sepsis treatment, as well as facilitate bidirectional feedback between residency and hospital leaders.

Of note, the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign update was released during my tenure. The increased focus on minimizing time to intervention led to controversy in our system as a nurse-initiated antibiotic  protocol in the ED was considered. I aided in systematic review of both local data and research literature, finding communication delays were more frequently to blame. Working with departmental leaders, we corrected unexpected EMR behavior which was frustrating contact with non-ED physicians once patients were admitted.

## WSU USIG

Planned, prepared, and led guided POCUS didactic sessions for  WSU medical students through ultrasound skills workshop held quarterly comprised of 4 rotating sessions of 10-20 students.

My sessions focused on central line, ultrasound-guided peripheral IV, and thoracentesis  as a springboard to build students' facility with orienting to ultrasound anatomy and pairing that to hand skills.

I created and successively refined both the teaching approach and realistic practice models using ballistics gel and tubing. Last year I added 3D-printed clavicles to introduce the greater challenge of the subclavian approach in contrast to the traditional unobstructed femoral or jugular simulation for interested learners.

## Women and Childrens' Free Restaurant

The WCFR is a local Spokane organization which assembles shelf-stable meals from donated food for distribution, and provides meals directly to homeless shelters.

My wife and I volunteer regularly there sorting, preparing, and distributing meals. In addition to being a worthy cause, it serves as time to stay out of the spotlight and listen to the experiences of others.

## POCUS Project

- [ ] submitted

During my training, I observed that while point-of-care ultrasound is frequently discussed and available, it remains underutilized by trainees. They often acknowledge its value but lack confidence in obtaining critical views unassisted. Conversely, regular users of POCUS gain skill and confidence through repeated practice.

As part of the Clinician Educator Fellowship, I am leading a project to use rapid spaced repetition with feedback to elevate trainees' proficiency, enabling them to use ultrasound imaging on an independent and accurate basis. As their use of ultrasound becomes more regular, I hypothesize they will continue building their skills autonomously. I will be happy to provide results when available.
