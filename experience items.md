CEF

This program is similar to a traditional chief resident year, but focus is placed on building didactic skills and completing long-term education projects.

I serve as attending physician in the inpatient and clinic settings, then receive regular performance reviews from other faculty.

I admit I have felt a new, heavier mantle of responsibility for the last two months I have been in this position. That has fueled me to do more reading, detailed exams, and comprehensive histories than ever before.

Even more complex is the careful creation of a team environment which affords appropriate autonomy to trainees without risking poor outcomes. It is surprisingly easy to take control of a case as attending, even unintentionally.

I have derived immense satisfaction at seeing my trainees progress with my guidance.
